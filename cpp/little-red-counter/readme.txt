Little Red Counter - Tyler Hippard
Requires: Counter.h and Counter.cpp

Steps to use the Little Red Counter:
  Optional: For the best experience, ensure your console window supports ANSI escape codes.
  1. Input the size of the little red counter (invalid entries will default to '9999'
  2. Select the input option, followed by a single-digit number to add to the counter.
     Entering 'r' will reset the counter, and 'o' will add the max size of the counter, causing an overflow.
  3. If the counter goes over the inputted size, an overflow warning will appear, prompting you to reset the counter.
