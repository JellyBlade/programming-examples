## Vowel Analysis - Tyler Hippard

Requires: n/a

Steps to use Vowel Analysis
  1. Download the files in this subfolder, and compile with your favourite c++ compiler.
  2. Enter the location of a text file to read.
  3. The program will output an ASCII graph to '(filename)-analysis.txt'

 
Here's an example of the analysis file for a test file with >10k vowels, where the graph's max becomes the highest vowel count, and everything is weighted based on that.
