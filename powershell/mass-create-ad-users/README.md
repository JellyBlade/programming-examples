## Mass-Create AD Users - Tyler Hippard
*My first powershell script*

A quick and dirty script for creating multiple users, adding them to your domain, setting their OU hierarchy, and adding them to a list of groups. 
I used this for my networking class to quickly setup my active directory for my final project.

Requires: Active Directory, the ability to edit said active directory through powershell, and the ability to run powershell scripts.

Usage:
  1. Download Mass-Create AD User.ps1
  2. Run it and answer the questions, and enjoy setting up lots of users in a somewhat faster pace than doing it by hand in ADUC.
